## 🔄 The Pattern Established

### Assessment Droid Workflow
```
1. Analyze codebase
2. Detect issues/patterns
3. Generate detailed report with examples
4. CREATE TASKS in tasks/tasks-[domain]-[date].md
   ├─ Categorize by severity (🔴 🟠 🟡 🟢)
   ├─ Include file paths and line numbers
   ├─ Provide secure/proper code examples
   └─ Estimate remediation effort
5. No code modification
```

### Action Droid Workflow
```
1. READ TASKS from task file
2. Mark task as started ([ ] → [~])
3. Implement fix/improvement
4. Run tests to verify
5. UPDATE TASK STATUS
   ├─ Success: Mark completed ([~] → [x])
   └─ Failure: Mark failed ([~] → [!])
6. No assessment logic
```

## 🎯 Example Workflows

### Security Improvement Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Assessment (Analyze → Create Tasks)
Task tool with subagent_type="security-assessment-droid-forge" \
  description="Security vulnerability assessment" \
  prompt "Scan codebase for security vulnerabilities, generate detailed report with CVSS scores, and create prioritized remediation tasks in tasks/tasks-security-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"

# Output: tasks/tasks-security-20250111.md
# - [ ] 1.1 Fix SQL injection in UserController.authenticate() - CVSS: 9.8 - Critical
# - [ ] 1.2 Fix XSS in CommentDisplay.render() - CVSS: 8.2 - High
# - [ ] 1.3 Update lodash@4.17.15 to 4.17.21 - CVE-2020-8203 - High

# Step 2: Review and prioritize (Human)

# Step 3: Remediation (Execute → Update Tasks)
Task tool with subagent_type="security-fix-droid-forge" \
  description="Execute security remediation" \
  prompt "Process security tasks from tasks/tasks-security-20250111.md in priority order. Implement fixes with secure code patterns, run security tests after each fix, and update task status."

# Result:
# - [x] 1.1 Fix SQL injection - Implemented parameterized queries, tests pass
# - [x] 1.2 Fix XSS - Added output encoding, tests pass  
# - [x] 1.3 Update lodash - Updated to 4.17.21, tests pass
```

### Code Quality Workflow (Multi-Domain)
```bash
# Step 1: Run all assessments in parallel
Task tool with subagent_type="code-smell-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Assess code smells and create tasks"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="cognitive-complexity-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Assess complexity and create tasks"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="security-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Assess security and create tasks"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="typescript-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Assess type safety and create tasks"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="test-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Assess test coverage and create tasks"

# Step 2: Review all findings, consolidate priorities

# Step 3: Execute fixes by priority
Task tool with subagent_type="security-fix-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Fix critical security issues first"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="code-refactoring-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Refactor critical code smells"
  
Task tool with subagent_type="typescript-fix-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Improve critical type safety issues"
```
