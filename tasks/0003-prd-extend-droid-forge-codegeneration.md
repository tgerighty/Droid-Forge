# Product Requirements Document: Extend Droid Forge with Code Generation Ecosystem (v1.2)

## Introduction/Overview

Extend Droid Forge v1.1 with specialized code generation capabilities to provide AI-powered development assistance across major software engineering roles. This extension introduces 8 new development droids modeled after proven AI coding assistants, enabling intelligent code creation, refactoring, and architectural guidance while maintaining seamless BAAS integration and audit trail compliance.

## Goals

- Provide AI-assisted development capabilities covering core software development roles (senior engineer, frontend, backend, UI/UX)
- Enable intelligent code generation with project stack compatibility verification
- Integrate automated quality assurance checks post-code generation
- Offer both high-level architectural guidance and specific implementation assistance
- Maintain Droid Forge's orchestration excellence while expanding development workflow support

## User Stories

### Development Workflow Enhancement
- As a senior developer, I want comprehensive code generation assistance to bootstrap projects quickly and maintain best practices
- As a frontend engineer, I want React/component generation capabilities with responsive design integration
- As a backend developer, I want API/microservice scaffolding with database integration guidance
- As a UI/UX designer, I want interface mockup generation and usability validation assistance

### AI-Powered Development Support
- As an engineering lead, I want intelligent refactoring recommendations to modernize legacy codebases
- As a system architect, I want automated architecture planning and pattern recommendations
- As a debugging specialist, I want advanced code analysis and debugging assistance
- As a quality engineer, I want automated code quality validation with AI-generated improvement suggestions

## Functional Requirements

1. **Core Development Droids Implementation**
   - Implement 4 foundational development role droids (senior-software-engineer-droid-forge, frontend-engineer-droid-forge, backend-engineer-droid-forge, ui-ux-designer-droid-forge)
   - Provide specialized capabilities for web-based development stack with extensible architecture
   - Include project stack compatibility verification and adjustment mechanisms

2. **Advanced Code Processing Droids Implementation**
   - Implement 4 specialized AI assistance droids (code-generation-orchestrator-droid-forge, refactoring-specialist-droid-forge, architecture-consultant-droid-forge, debugging-expert-droid-forge)
   - Focus on high-impact development workflows (refactoring, debugging, architecture planning)
   - Integrate sophisticated AI assistance with human oversight capabilities

3. **BAAS Integration and Workflow Orchestration**
   - Configure BAAS delegation rules for all new code generation capabilities
   - Implement automatic quality assurance triggering after code generation operations
   - Enable conflict resolution between conflicting droid recommendations
   - Establish audit trail logging for all code generation activities

4. **Quality Assurance Integration**
   - Trigger Code Quality Orchestrator automatically after any code generation
   - Include Integration Testing Droid validation where applicable
   - Implement code quality metrics tracking for generated content
   - Provide validation feedback loops with improvement suggestions

5. **Project Stack Compatibility Assurance**
   - Implement real-time technology stack detection and verification
   - Ensure generated code compatibility with current project versions and configurations
   - Provide alternative implementation suggestions for compatibility issues
   - Maintain version-aware code generation patterns

6. **Output Format Flexibility**
   - Support complete project skeleton generation
   - Enable individual component and file creation
   - Provide focused code snippet generation with documentation
   - Include testing scaffolding generation where appropriate

## Non-Goals

- Complete IDE replacement functionality
- Machine learning model training or custom AI development
- Infrastructure provisioning beyond code-level guidance
- Performance monitoring and alerting implementation (already covered in v1.1)
- External toolchain integration beyond Git/quality assurance systems

## Design Considerations

The droids will be designed as specialized extensions of proven AI coding assistant patterns (inspired by Claude agents), with each focusing on specific development roles while maintaining Droid Forge's orchestration philosophy. Development droids will leverage AI assistance capabilities while integrating seamlessly with existing BAAS workflows and quality assurance pipelines.

## Technical Considerations

Each code generation droid must:
- Follow Factory.ai template specifications
- Include BAAS delegate compatibility
- Implement audit trail logging in NDJSON format
- Support ai-dev-tasks process integration
- Provide error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Maintain codebase consistency with existing patterns

## Success Metrics

- Successful integration with BAAS orchestration (all droids delegatable)
- 100% compatibility with Factory.ai template requirements
- Positive developer feedback on code generation capabilities
- Quality assurance integration verifies generated code quality
- Stack compatibility verification prevents version conflicts

## Open Questions

- Which specific technology stacks should receive initial focus for code generation capabilities?
- How should AI-generated code ownership and attribution be handled in version control?
- What level of customization should users have for code generation preferences?
- How to balance AI assistance vs human development control in the workflow?
