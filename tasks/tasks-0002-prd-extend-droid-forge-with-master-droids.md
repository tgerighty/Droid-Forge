  - [ ] 1.3 Prioritize droids for integration based on domain coverage and utility
  - [ ] 1.4 Document droid capabilities and compatibility requirements
  - [ ] 1.5 Identify potential capability overlaps and resolution strategies
  - [ ] 1.6 Create integration priority matrix (immediate, phased, optional)
- [ ] 2.0 Droid Integration and Adaptation
  - [ ] 2.1 Copy security-related droids (security-review, security-audit)
  - [ ] 2.2 Copy database-related droids (database-migration, optimize-database-performance)
  - [ ] 2.3 Copy debugging and issue resolution droids (fix-issue, debug-error, debug-issue)
  - [ ] 2.4 Copy testing and quality droids (setup-comprehensive-testing)
  - [ ] 2.5 Copy development workflow droids (setup-new-feature, implement-caching-strategy)
  - [ ] 2.6 Copy monitoring and performance droids (performance-audit, setup-monitoring-observability)
  - [ ] 2.7 Copy onboarding and project assistance droids (onboard-new-developer)
  - [ ] 2.8 Standardize all copied droids to Factory.ai template format
  - [ ] 2.9 Validate YAML frontmatter completeness for all integrated droids
  - [ ] 2.10 Resolve capability function overlaps by extracting reusable components
- [ ] 3.0 BAAS Orchestration Updates
  - [ ] 3.1 Update droid-forge.yaml with new delegation rules for all integrated droids
  - [ ] 3.2 Enhance BAAS orchestrator with category-based droid routing logic
  - [ ] 3.3 Add concurrent execution capabilities for parallel droid workflows

  - [ ] 4.1 Test BAAS delegation to each newly integrated droid category
  - [ ] 4.2 Validate droid execution compatibility with Factory.ai CLI
  - [ ] 4.3 Test concurrent droid operations using locking mechanisms
  - [ ] 4.4 Verify event logging for all new droid executions
  - [ ] 4.5 Validate droid capability detection and matching accuracy
  - [ ] 4.6 Perform integration testing for cross-droid workflow combinations
- [ ] 5.0 Documentation and Analytics Update
  - [ ] 5.1 Update README.md with all integrated droid descriptions and capabilities

  - [ ] 5.5 Create droid selection guide based on project technology stack
  - [ ] 5.6 Document maintenance procedures for large droid library

## Implementation Notes

- Implement droids in phases: security first, then database, debugging, and workflow support
- Maintain high standards for Factory.ai template compliance across all additions
- Document any function consolidations from overlapping droids for future reference
- Focus on ensuring BAAS can intelligently delegate across the expanded catalog
- Include statistical tracking to identify most valuable added capabilities
- Keep v1.1 as focused extension rather than major architectural changes

## General Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Include appropriate error handling and logging
- Ensure comprehensive integration with existing framework components
