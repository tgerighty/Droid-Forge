- [ ] 3.0 Advanced Code Processing Droids Implementation (4 Droids)
  - [ ] 3.1 Implement code-generation-orchestrator-droid-forge for AI-assisted code synthesis (delegates to other generation droids)
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement refactoring-specialist-droid-forge for intelligent code modernization (inspired by code-refactoring-expert Claude agent)
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement architecture-consultant-droid-forge for system design guidance (inspired by architect, systems-architect agents)
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement debugging-expert-droid-forge for advanced code analysis (inspired by code-analyzer-debugger, debug-error agents)
  - [ ] 3.5 Configure AI assist levels with human oversight decision points (question 2)

- [ ] 4.0 BAAS Integration and Workflow Orchestration
  - [ ] 4.1 Update droid-forge.yaml with delegation rules for all 8 new code generation droids
  - [ ] 4.2 Configure BAAS quality assurance triggering after code generation droid invocation (question 3)

- [ ] 6.0 Documentation and Ecosystem Integration
  - [ ] 6.1 Update README.md with all new code generation capabilities and examples
  - [ ] 6.2 Add usage examples for each specialized droid role in documentation
  - [ ] 6.3 Create usage guidance for BAAS orchestration of code generation workflows
  - [ ] 6.4 Update ASCII diagrams to show code generation integration points

- [ ] 7.0 Testing and Validation of Code Generation Features
  - [ ] 7.1 Test BAAS delegation to each new code generation droid
  - [ ] 7.2 Validate quality assurance integration with code generation workflows
  - [ ] 7.3 Test stack compatibility verification mechanisms
  - [ ] 7.4 Demonstrate end-to-end code generation workflow (project skeleton → component → testing)

## Implementation Notes

- Each code generation droid should prioritize output format flexibility: complete projects, individual components, documented snippets (question 4)
- AI assist should maintain human control with decision checkpoints while providing significant productivity benefits (question 2)
- Stack compatibility verification should be automatic and enforced before final code generation (question 6)
- Success metrics focus on practical developer productivity rather than AI performance scores (question 10 removed)
- Follow Claude agent patterns for domain specialization while adapting to Droid Forge BAAS orchestration requirements
- Maintain clean separation between code generation (creation) and code quality/refactoring (improvement)

## General Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Include appropriate error handling and logging
- Ensure comprehensive integration with existing framework components
