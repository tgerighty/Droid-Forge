## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Create an autonomous one-shot execution mode for Droid Forge that enables AI agents to complete entire feature implementations, from initial code generation through testing, validation, and deployment, without human intervention for routine decisions.

### 1.2 Background

**Current State (AGENTS.md)**:
- Agents pause between tasks for confirmation
- Human-in-the-loop decision points throughout workflow
- Step-by-step progression with status update requests
- Manual coordination between development phases

**Desired State (AGENTS-ONE-SHOT.md)**:
- Continuous autonomous execution of entire task lists
- Automatic progression through all sub-tasks
- Comprehensive testing and validation at each step
- Automatic status updates and commit management
- Human review only at major milestones or failures

### 1.3 Scope

**In Scope**:
- One-shot execution mode for all task types
- Autonomous testing and validation
- Automatic commit and status management
- Error handling and recovery
- Quality assurance automation
- Progress logging and reporting

**Out of Scope**:
- Replacing human code review (reviews still required)
- Production deployment decisions (human approval needed)
- Architecture decision-making (human input required)
- Security policy changes (human approval required)

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories

**As a Senior Developer**, I want to:
- Assign an entire feature to an AI agent and receive a complete, tested implementation
- Review only the final PR instead of intermediate steps
- Trust that all sub-tasks have been properly tested and validated

**As an AI Agent**, I want to:
- Execute all tasks in a list autonomously without asking permission
- Automatically handle testing, validation, and commits
- Recover from errors and continue execution
- Provide comprehensive logs of all actions taken

**As a Product Manager**, I want to:
- See features implemented faster with maintained quality
- Track progress automatically through logged milestones
- Receive notifications only for significant events or blockers

### 3.2 Detailed Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Full-Stack Feature Implementation

```
Given: A PRD for "User Profile Management" with 8 major tasks
When: Agent executes in one-shot mode
Then:
  - Agent implements all 8 tasks sequentially
  - Each sub-task is coded, tested, and committed
  - End-to-end tests run after each major task
  - Status updates logged automatically
  - Final PR created with complete implementation
  - Human review requested only at completion
```

#### Scenario 2: Bug Fix with Test Addition

```
Given: A bug report with reproduction steps
When: Agent executes fix in one-shot mode
Then:
  - Agent analyzes bug and identifies root cause
  - Implements fix with proper error handling
  - Adds regression test to prevent recurrence
  - Runs all affected tests
  - Commits fix and tests together
  - Creates PR with bug analysis and fix description
```

#### Scenario 3: Database Migration

```
Given: Schema change requirement with 5 migration steps
When: Agent executes migration in one-shot mode
Then:
  - Agent creates migration scripts for all steps
  - Writes rollback scripts for each migration
  - Creates integration tests for migrations
  - Tests migration up/down sequences
  - Documents migration process
  - Commits each migration as separate commit
  - Creates PR with migration documentation
```

## 4. Current State Analysis

### 4.1 Current AGENTS.md Workflow

```
User Request
    ↓
Agent analyzes task
    ↓
Ask: "Shall I proceed with task 1.1?"  ← HUMAN DECISION
    ↓
Execute task 1.1
    ↓
Ask: "Shall I commit?" ← HUMAN DECISION
    ↓
Commit code
    ↓
Ask: "Shall I proceed with task 1.2?"  ← HUMAN DECISION
    ↓
[Repeat for each sub-task]
```

**Bottlenecks**:
- Multiple human decision points (10-15 per feature)
- Context switching overhead
- Delayed progression between tasks
- Inconsistent execution patterns
- Time zone dependencies for approvals

### 4.2 Pain Points

1. **Velocity**: Features take 4-6 hours due to approval delays
2. **Context Switching**: Developers interrupted 10-15 times per feature
3. **Inconsistency**: Different agents interpret "proceed" differently
4. **Overhead**: Simple tasks require disproportionate supervision
5. **Scalability**: Can't scale to multiple simultaneous features

---

## 5. Proposed Solution

### 5.1 One-Shot Execution Model

```
User Request with Task List
    ↓
Agent enters ONE-SHOT MODE
    ↓
FOR EACH Major Task (1.0, 2.0, 3.0...):
    │
    ├─ Execute ALL Sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 1.3...)
    │  ├─ Code implementation
    │  ├─ Unit tests
    │  └─ Commit
    │
    ├─ Integration testing
    │  └─ Verify sub-tasks work together
    │
    ├─ End-to-end testing
    │  └─ Validate major task completion
    │
    ├─ Quality checks
    │  ├─ Linting
    │  ├─ Formatting
    │  └─ Security scan
    │
    └─ Update status automatically
    │
    ↓ [Repeat for next major task]
    │
Final PR Creation
    ↓
Human Review (ONLY AT END)
```

### 5.2 Key Innovations

**1. Autonomous Task Chains**
- Execute 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 without pausing
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Smart error recovery

**2. Layered Testing Strategy**
```
Level 1: Unit Tests (per sub-task)
    ↓
Level 2: Integration Tests (per major task)
    ↓
Level 3: End-to-End Tests (entire feature)
    ↓
Level 4: Regression Tests (system-wide)
```

**3. Smart Commit Strategy**
```
Commit Pattern:
- Sub-task completion: Individual commits
- Related sub-tasks: Grouped commits
- Major task completion: Milestone commit
- Quality fixes: Amendment to previous commit
```

**4. Automatic Status Management**
```yaml
Task Status Lifecycle:
  pending → executing → testing → validated → committed → completed
```

## Appendix C: Risk Assessment

### High Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Autonomous agent makes incorrect assumptions | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing at each step, human review before merge |
| Test failures cascade causing workflow stalls | Medium | Medium | Smart retry logic, continue-on-failure for non-critical |
| Security vulnerabilities introduced | Low | Critical | Automatic security scans, block on critical issues |
| Performance degradation undetected | Medium | Medium | Automatic performance benchmarks, alerts on regressions |
| Code quality suffers without review | Low | Medium | Automatic linting, formatting, enforce quality gates |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Over-commit granularity clutters history | Medium | Low | Smart commit grouping, squash option for final PR |
| Excessive log verbosity | High | Low | Configurable log levels, structured logging |
| Cost of running extensive test suites | Medium | Low | Parallel test execution, smart test selection |
| Learning curve for developers | Medium | Low | Comprehensive documentation, examples, training |

### Low Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Integration issues with existing droids | Low | Medium | Thorough integration testing, backwards compatibility |
| Configuration complexity | Low | Low | Sensible defaults, validation, clear documentation |
| Network connectivity issues | Medium | Low | Retry logic, offline mode, state persistence |
