### Notes

- All droids must follow Factory.ai specification (markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- Use Factory.ai CLI (`droid`) for all droid discovery and execution
- No custom Python code for core functionality - only analysis tools
- Task status updates use inline markers: `status: scheduled|started|completed`
- All logging uses NDJSON format in `.factory/logs/` directory
- Integration with existing Factory.ai droid ecosystem via personal droids
- Git workflows coordinated through specialized droid, not direct commands
