# Product Requirements Document: Extend Droid Forge with Master Droids (v1.1)

## Introduction
Expand Droid Forge v1.0 into a comprehensive development factory by integrating additional droids from the master factory droids store. This enhancement will create a complete automation ecosystem covering software development, database management, security, containerization, and development workflow support, even if some droids may see limited practical usage.

## Goals
- Integrate all suitable droids from the master factory droids store to provide a complete development automation suite
- Fill gaps in current Droid Forge capabilities across key technology domains
- Optimize droid selection based on actual usage statistics to understand ecosystem effectiveness
- Maintain consistent Factory.ai template structure across all integrated droids

## User Stories
### Developer Experience
- As a software developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools to quickly identify and resolve issues, so I can maintain development velocity
- As a team lead, I want intelligent onboarding assistance to help new developers understand projects and create effective PRDs
- As a DevOps engineer, I want integrated security auditing capabilities to ensure secure applications and infrastructure

### Architecture Enhancement
- As a system architect, I want database performance optimization tools to improve application performance and scalability
- As a platform engineer, I want container orchestration capabilities to manage Docker environments
- As a full-stack developer, I want integrated testing frameworks for both backend (database, API) and frontend (React/Next.js, Three.js) technologies

## Functional Requirements
1. **Droid Evaluation and Selection**
   - Review all master factory droids store entries
   - Assess each droid for relevance to software development lifecycle
   - Prioritize inclusion based on technology domain coverage
   - Skip PRD generator (redundant with existing implementation)

2. **Technology Domain Coverage**
   - Database management (PostgreSQL-focused droids)
   - Security auditing and vulnerability assessment
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Onboarding and project assistance droids
   - Testing setup and debugging utilities

3. **Droid Integration Standards**
   - All integrated droids must follow official Factory.ai template structure
   - YAML frontmatter with proper metadata (name, version, tools, description)
   - Consistent markdown formatting and documentation
   - Proper tool declaration and capability description

4. **Overlap Resolution**
   - Identify droids with overlapping capabilities (e.g., multiple debugging tools)
   - Analyze functional differences between overlapping droids
   - Extract and combine valuable functions from "suggest" droids into primary implementations
   - Maintain specialization where it provides clear value

5. **Framework Statistics and Analytics**
   - Implement usage tracking for each integrated droid
   - Collect metrics on droid invocation frequency
   - Log performance data for optimization insights
   - Enable data-driven decisions on droid prioritization

6. **Quality Assurance**
   - Validate all droids follow Factory.ai template standards
   - Ensure compatible tool arrays and capability declarations
   - Test BAAS orchestration integration for each droid
   - Verify documentation completeness and accuracy

## Non-Goals
- Implementation of actual runtime testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, etc.) in the framework repository - these are for user projects
- Modification of core Droid Forge architectural decisions
- Addition of new core components beyond droid integration
- Hardware-specific or low-level system droids

## Design Considerations
The droids will follow the established markdown-based architecture with YAML frontmatter and embedded bash functions. Integration points will leverage the existing BAAS orchestration system without requiring core platform changes.

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain compatibility with existing Factory.ai CLI conventions
- Ensure droids can be selectively installed/enabled by users
- Design for cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows support via WSL)
- Implement proper error handling and graceful failure modes
- Support concurrent droid execution where appropriate

## Success Metrics
- Complete integration of all viable droids from master store
- 100% adherence to Factory.ai template standards across integrated droids
- Successful BAAS delegation to all new integrated droids
- Functional verification of major domain capabilities

## Open Questions
- Which specific droids should be prioritized for initial integration?
- How should overlap resolution decisions be documented and communicated?
- What level of statistical tracking should be implemented for droid usage?
- How to handle droid versioning when updates occur in master store?
