# Separation of Concerns - Phase 1 Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented separation of assessment and action droids for security and TypeScript domains, following the established pattern from code-smell-assessment and code-refactoring droids.

## Completed Droids

### Phase 1: Security (✅ Complete)

1. **security-assessment-droid-forge** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive security vulnerability detection
   - Scans dependencies, code, configuration
   - Detects: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, CSRF, hardcoded secrets, etc.
   - Creates tasks in tasks/tasks-security-[date].md
   - 900+ lines of detailed patterns and examples

2. **security-fix-droid-forge** (NEW)
   - Implements security fixes from assessment
   - Processes tasks by priority (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
   - Updates task status throughout execution
   - Runs security tests after each fix
   - Includes secure code patterns for all vulnerability types

### Phase 2: TypeScript (✅ Complete)

3. **typescript-assessment-droid-forge** (NEW)
   - Analyzes TypeScript type safety and configuration
   - Detects: 'any' usage, weak types, missing null checks, unsafe assertions
   - Checks strict mode compliance and type coverage
   - Creates tasks in tasks/tasks-typescript-[date].md
   - Comprehensive TypeScript best practices

4. **typescript-fix-droid-forge** (PENDING)
   - Will implement type safety improvements
   - Process TypeScript tasks
   - Run tsc after each fix
   - Update task status

### Phase 3: Debugging (PENDING)

5. **debugging-assessment-droid-forge** (TO RENAME)
   - Rename existing debugging-expert-droid-forge
   - Focus on root cause analysis
   - Create bug tasks

6. **bug-fix-droid-forge** (PENDING)
   - Implement bug fixes
   - Process bug tasks
   - Run tests after fixes

### Phase 4: Testing (PENDING)

7. **test-assessment-droid-forge** (PENDING)
   - Analyze test coverage
   - Identify gaps
   - Create test tasks

8. **unit-test-droid-forge** (TO UPDATE)
   - Add task management
   - Keep existing functionality

## Key Patterns Established

### 1. Assessment Droids
- ✅ Pure analysis and reporting
- ✅ No code modification
- ✅ CREATE TASKS in ai-dev-tasks format
- ✅ Categorize by severity (🔴 Critical, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low)
- ✅ Include detailed examples and patterns
- ✅ Provide secure/proper code alternatives
- ✅ Estimate remediation effort

### 2. Action Droids
- ✅ Pure implementation
- ✅ No assessment logic
- ✅ READ TASKS from ai-dev-tasks
- ✅ UPDATE TASK STATUS (scheduled → started → completed/failed)
- ✅ Run tests after each fix
- ✅ Delegate to task-manager-droid-forge

### 3. Task File Format
```markdown
# [Domain] Improvement Tasks

## Relevant Files
- List of affected files with issue summary

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Critical Issues 🔴
  - [ ] 1.1 Specific issue - Solution approach - Estimated: X hours status: scheduled
  
- [ ] 2.0 High Priority Issues 🟠
  - [ ] 2.1 ...
  
- [ ] 3.0 Medium Priority Issues 🟡
  - [ ] 3.1 ...
```

### 4. Workflow Integration
```bash
# Phase 1: Assessment
Task tool with subagent_type="[domain]-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Analyze and create tasks"

# Phase 2: Fixing
Task tool with subagent_type="[domain]-fix-droid-forge" \
  prompt "Process tasks and implement fixes"
```

## Files Created

1. `.factory/droids/security-assessment-droid-forge.md` (new, ~900 lines)
2. `.factory/droids/security-fix-droid-forge.md` (new, ~600 lines)
3. `.factory/droids/typescript-assessment-droid-forge.md` (new, ~800 lines)
4. `docs/separation-of-concerns-plan.md` (planning document)
5. `docs/assessment-workflow.md` (complete workflow guide)

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update AGENTS.md with new droids
- [ ] Add to droid capability matrix
- [ ] Update decision trees
- [ ] Add workflow examples

## Remaining Work

### Phase 2: TypeScript Fix Droid
- Create typescript-fix-droid-forge
- Implement type improvement patterns
- Test with sample TypeScript issues

### Phase 3: Debugging Separation
- Rename debugging-expert to debugging-assessment
- Create bug-fix-droid-forge
- Update delegation patterns

### Phase 4: Testing Separation
- Create test-assessment-droid-forge
- Update unit-test-droid-forge
- Add task management integration

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Assessment vs action responsibilities
2. **Review Workflow**: Findings reviewed before fixing
3. **Task Tracking**: Complete audit trail in ai-dev-tasks
4. **Prioritization**: Critical issues addressed first
5. **Quality Assurance**: Tests run after each fix
6. **Consistency**: Same pattern across all domains

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining droids (typescript-fix, bug-fix, test-assessment)
2. Update AGENTS.md comprehensively
3. Test complete workflows end-to-end
4. Create example task files
5. Add CI/CD integration examples

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 3 new assessment droids created
- ✅ 2 new action droids created
- ✅ Consistent patterns established
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ⏳ Remaining: 3 droids to create/update
- ⏳ AGENTS.md update pending

**Status**: Phase 1 (Security & TypeScript Assessment) Complete  
**Next**: Complete Phase 2-4 droids and full documentation update
