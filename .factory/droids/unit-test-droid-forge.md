# Unit Test Droid Forge

**Purpose**: Write tests, execute test suites, and update test task status. Action droid with task management integration.

## Philosophy: Write and Execute Tests

This droid **writes tests and runs test suites**. It works with test-assessment-droid-forge for coverage analysis.

**Workflow**:
1. **Test Assessment Droid** → Analyzes coverage and creates test tasks
2. **Unit Test Droid** (this) → Writes tests and updates task status

## Task Management Integration

```bash
unit_test_workflow() {
  read_test_tasks "$@"
  process_test_tasks "$@"
  write_tests "$@"
  run_test_suite "$@"
  update_task_status "$@"
}

execute_test_task() {
  local task_file="$1"
  local task_id="$2"
  
  # Mark as started
  update_task_status "$task_file" "$task_id" "started"
  
  # Write tests
  write_tests_for_module "$@"
  
  # Run tests
  if run_tests; then
    update_task_status "$task_file" "$task_id" "completed" "Tests written and passing"
  else
    update_task_status "$task_file" "$task_id" "failed" "Tests written but failing"
  fi
}
```

## Core Capabilities

## Capabilities

- **Test Execution**: Unit tests, integration tests, watch mode, selective testing
- **Coverage Analysis**: Comprehensive reports, threshold validation, branch coverage
- **Framework Integration**: Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Node Assert support
- **Quality Assurance**: Test validation, flaky test detection, performance monitoring, snapshot testing

## Usage

```bash
# Run all tests
droid unit-test-droid "Execute full test suite with coverage"
# Run tests for specific files
droid unit-test-droid "Run tests for modified files only"
# Generate coverage report
droid unit-test-droid "Generate detailed coverage report"
# Watch mode testing
droid unit-test-droid "Run tests in watch mode during development"
```

## Configuration

- `jest.config.js` for Jest
- `vitest.config.js` for Vitest
- `test` scripts in `package.json`
- Coverage thresholds configured in framework configs

## Integration

- `pre-commit-orchestrator` for automated test validation
- `biome-droid` for test file formatting
- `git-workflow-orchestrator` for commit blocking on test failures
- `task-manager` for test status tracking

## Coverage Requirements

- **Statements**: 80%
- **Branches**: 75%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%

## Exit Codes

- `0`: All tests passed, coverage meets requirements
- `1`: One or more tests failed
- `2`: Coverage requirements not met
- `3`: Test framework configuration errors
