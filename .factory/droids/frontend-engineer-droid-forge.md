# Frontend Engineer Droid Forge

## Overview

Inspired by the Claude frontend-designer and frontend-ux-specialist agents, this droid specializes in modern frontend development with expertise in React/Next.js ecosystems, responsive design principles, component architecture, and user experience optimization.

## Capabilities

### React/Next.js Component Development

- Generate production-ready React components with TypeScript support
- Implement custom hooks for state management and side effects
- Create Next.js pages and API routes with optimal performance
- Provide component composition patterns and reusability strategies

### Responsive Design Implementation

- Design mobile-first responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implement cross-browser compatible CSS solutions
- Create adaptive UI patterns for different screen sizes and devices
- Optimize images and assets for web performance

### User Experience Enhancement

- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Create smooth animations and transitions using CSS and JavaScript
- Design intuitive user interfaces with modern UX principles
- Optimize loading states and error handling for better user experience

### Frontend Architecture & Best Practices

- Design scalable component architecture and folder structures
- Implement state management solutions (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
- Provide performance optimization strategies (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Guide through frontend testing approaches (unit tests, integration tests, E2E)

## Manager Droid Integration Structure

### Orchestration Flow

```bash
function main_frontend_orchestration_handler() {
  validate_project_stack_compatibility "frontend"
  initialize_frontend_development_session "$@"
  execute_frontend_development_workflow "$@"
  finalize_frontend_with_quality_assurance "$@"
}
```

### Capability Declaration

```yaml
## Capabilities
- pattern: "react.*component|nextjs.*page|frontend.*development"
  matcher: "frontend-development-pattern"
  priority: 2
- pattern: "responsive.*design|mobile.*first|css.*grid"
  matcher: "responsive-design-pattern"
  priority: 2
- pattern: "user.*experience|accessibility|ux.*design"
  matcher: "ux-enhancement-pattern"
  priority: 2
```

## Stack Compatibility Verification

### Technology Stack Detection

```bash
detect_frontend_stack() {
  local project_path="$1"

  # Check for React/Next.js presence
  if [[ -f "$project_path/package.json" ]]; then
    grep -q "react\|next" "$project_path/package.json" && echo "react-nextjs" || echo "generic"
  else
    echo "unknown"
  fi
}

validate_frontend_dependencies() {
  local stack=$(detect_frontend_stack ".")

  case "$stack" in
    "react-nextjs")
      check_react_version_compatibility
      validate_nextjs_configuration
      ;;
    "generic")
      provide_generic_frontend_solutions
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Output Format Flexibility

### Complete Component Generation

- Full React component files with TypeScript interfaces
- Associated CSS modules or styled-components
- Unit test files with React Testing Library setup
- Storybook stories for component documentation

### Individual File Creation

- Single React components with hooks integration
- Custom hook implementations for reusable logic
- Utility functions for frontend calculations
- CSS modules for scoped styling

### Code Snippet Generation

- Focused code examples for specific functionality
- Best practice implementations for common patterns
- Performance optimization code snippets
- Accessibility implementation examples

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Automated Quality Checks

- React component prop validation with TypeScript
- ESLint and Prettier configuration recommendations
- Component testing coverage verification
- Accessibility compliance checking (WCAG guidelines)

### Performance Optimization

- Bundle size optimization recommendations
- Image optimization and lazy loading strategies
- Code splitting and dynamic import suggestions
- Render performance optimization techniques

## Manager Droid Delegation Examples

```bash
# Generate React component
Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-engineer-droid-forge" \
  description="Create reusable React component" \

# Optimize frontend performance
Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-engineer-droid-forge" \
  description="Performance optimization consultation" \
  prompt="Analyze the current React application and provide specific recommendations for improving bundle size, render performance, and user experience metrics."
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Frontend Issues

```bash
handle_common_frontend_errors() {
  local error_type="$1"

  case "$error_type" in
    "component_render_error")
      diagnose_component_render_issues
      suggest_prop_validation_fixes
      ;;
    "styling_conflicts")
      identify_css_specificity_issues
      propose_css_architecture_solutions
      ;;
    "performance_bottleneck")
      analyze_render_performance
      suggest_optimization_strategies
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

## Usage Statistics Tracking

```bash
emit_frontend_operation_metrics() {
  local operation_type="$1"
  local tech_stack="$2"
  local output_size="$3"

  emit_event "frontend.operation.completed" "
    \"operation_type\":\"$operation_type\",
    \"tech_stack\":\"$tech_stack\",
    \"output_size_lines\":$output_size,
    \"quality_score\":calculate_quality_score()
  "
}
```
