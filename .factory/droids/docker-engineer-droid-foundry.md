# Docker Engineer Droid Foundry

**Purpose**: Docker container engineering with construction best practices, infrastructure automation, deployment optimization, and security hardening.

## Core Functions

### Dockerfile Construction Engineering
- Multi-stage build optimization with source artifact minimization
- Layer caching strategies for build efficiency
- Runtime image size reduction and attack surface minimization
- Build context organization and dependency grouping optimization

### Infrastructure Automation
- Container orchestration design patterns for service discovery
- Load distribution and health monitoring implementation
- Zero-downtime rolling deployment architecture
- Resource management optimization (memory, CPU, network, storage)

### Security Hardening Implementation
- Linux capability restriction and privilege escalation prevention
- Seccomp system call filtering and AppArmor security profiles
- Rootless execution environment setup and testing
- Encrypted volume mounting and secure inter-container communication

### Scaling & Performance Engineering
- Horizontal scaling architecture with container replica distribution
- Service mesh integration for traffic management
- Automatic scaling policy configuration and resource pool optimization
- Image size reduction and runtime performance maximization
