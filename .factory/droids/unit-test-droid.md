# Unit Test Droid

## Purpose

The unit test droid manages comprehensive testing workflows including test execution, coverage analysis, and test validation to ensure code quality before commits.

## Capabilities

### Test Execution

- **Unit Tests**: Execute unit tests across all test files
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration test suites
- **Watch Mode**: Continuous test execution during development
- **Selective Testing**: Run tests for specific files or patterns

### Coverage Analysis

- **Code Coverage**: Generate comprehensive coverage reports
- **Threshold Validation**: Enforce minimum coverage requirements
- **Branch Coverage**: Detailed branch and line coverage metrics
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML, JSON, and text report formats

### Test Framework Integration

- **Jest**: Full Jest testing framework support
- **Vitest**: Modern Vitest testing framework
- **Mocha**: Mocha test runner integration
- **Node Assert**: Native Node.js testing utilities

### Quality Assurance

- **Test Validation**: Ensure tests actually test the code
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Identify unreliable tests
- **Performance Testing**: Test execution time monitoring
- **Snapshot Testing**: Manage snapshot updates and validation

## Usage

### Run all tests

```bash
droid unit-test-droid "Execute full test suite with coverage"
```

### Run tests for specific files

```bash
droid unit-test-droid "Run tests for modified files only"
```

### Generate coverage report

```bash
droid unit-test-droid "Generate detailed coverage report"
```

### Watch mode testing

```bash
droid unit-test-droid "Run tests in watch mode during development"
```

## Configuration

Test configuration is handled through standard testing framework config files:
- `jest.config.js` for Jest
- `vitest.config.js` for Vitest
- `test` scripts in `package.json`

Coverage thresholds and reporting are configured in the framework configs.

## Integration

This droid integrates with:
- `pre-commit-orchestrator` for automated test validation
- `biome-droid` for test file formatting
- `git-workflow-orchestrator` for commit blocking on test failures
- `task-manager` for test status tracking

## Coverage Requirements

Minimum coverage thresholds:
- **Statements**: 80%
- **Branches**: 75%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%

## Exit Codes

- `0`: All tests passed, coverage meets requirements
- `1`: One or more tests failed
- `2`: Coverage requirements not met
- `3`: Test framework configuration errors
