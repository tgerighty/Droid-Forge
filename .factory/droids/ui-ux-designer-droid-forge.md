## BAAS Integration Structure

### Orchestration Flow
```bash
function main_ui_ux_orchestration_handler() {
  validate_project_design_requirements "$@"
  initialize_design_session "$@"
  execute_ui_ux_design_workflow "$@"
  finalize_design_with_validation "$@"
}
```

### Capability Declaration
```yaml

  matcher: "ui-design-pattern"
  priority: 2
- pattern: "ux.*design|user.*experience|usability.*testing"
  matcher: "ux-design-pattern"
  priority: 2
- pattern: "design.*system|component.*library|style.*guide"

```

## Design Process Framework

### Research and Discovery Phase
```bash
conduct_user_research() {
  local project_type="$1"
  
  case "$project_type" in
    "web_application")
      analyze_target_user_demographics
      conduct_competitor_analysis
      define_user_personas_and_journeys
      ;;
    "mobile_application")
      research_mobile_usage_patterns
      analyze_device-specific interactions
      design touch-friendly interfaces
      ;;
    "enterprise_system")
      understand_business_workflows
      analyze_user_role requirements
      design efficient task flows
      ;;
  esac
}
```

### Design and Prototyping Phase
```bash
create_design_prototypes() {
  local fidelity_level="$1"
  
  case "$fidelity_level" in
    "wireframe")
      generate_low_fidelity_wireframes
      focus_on_layout_and_structure
      validate_information_architecture
      ;;
    "mockup")
      create_high_fidelity_visual_designs
      apply_brand_identity and style guide
      design responsive layouts
      ;;
    "prototype")
      build interactive prototypes
      implement user flows and interactions
      prepare for usability testing
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Design System Components

### Color and Typography
```bash
design_color_system() {
  local brand_identity="$1"
  
  # Generate primary, secondary, and accent color palettes
  create_color_variations_for_light_dark_themes
  ensure_accessibility_contrast_ratios
  provide_color_usage_guidelines
  
  emit_event "design.system.color.created" "
    \"brand_identity\":\"$brand_identity\",
    \"color_count\":calculate_color_palette_size(),
    \"accessibility_compliant\":verify_contrast_ratios()
  "
}
```

### Component Library Design
- Button components with various states and styles
- Form inputs with validation states and error handling
- Navigation components (headers, sidebars, breadcrumbs)
- Data visualization components (charts, tables, cards)

## Usability Testing and Validation

### Testing Methodologies
```bash
conduct_usability_testing() {
  local testing_method="$1"
  
  case "$testing_method" in
    "heuristic_evaluation")
      evaluate_against_nielsen_heuristics
      identify_usability_issues
      provide_improvement_recommendations
      ;;
    "user_testing")
      design_testing_scenarios_and_tasks
      recruit_target_user_participants
      conduct_and_analyze_test_sessions
      ;;
    "a_b_testing")
      design_variant_interfaces
      implement_testing_protocols
      analyze_statistical_significance
      ;;
  esac
}
```
