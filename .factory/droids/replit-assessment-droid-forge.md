# Replit Assessment Droid

**Purpose**: Analyze tasks/PRDs to identify what Replit handles, marking those tasks as done and focusing development on what actually needs building.

## Prerequisites & Limitations

**⚠️ Important Requirements Before Using This Droid:**

- **Plan Requirements**: Advanced features may require paid Replit plans - verify tier capabilities
- **Database Work**: Complex database schemas and migrations still need manual development
- **External DNS**: Custom domains require external DNS configuration beyond Replit

## Replit Platform Capabilities

### ✅ Done by Replit (No Dev Needed)
- **Deployment**: Autoscale, static, reserved VM, scheduled, custom domains, SSL
- **CI/CD**: Auto builds, one-click deploy, env isolation, Git integration, testing
- **Database**: Built-in SQL, key-value store, storage, separate dev/prod, backups
- **Development**: Cloud IDE, real-time collab, Git, package mgmt, secrets, SSH
- **Infrastructure**: GCP hosting, 99.9% uptime, scaling, security, monitoring, alerts

### 🔄 Partial (Some Dev Needed)
- Database schema design, API code, build processes, env variable definitions

### 📝 Full Dev Required
- Business logic, UI components, API endpoints, auth, testing, documentation, integrations

## Task Assessment Rules

| Task Pattern | Replit Status | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| "Set up dev environment" | ✅ Done | Cloud IDE provided |
| "Configure hosting/deployment" | ✅ Done | Automatic deployment |
| "Set up CI/CD pipeline" | ✅ Done | Built-in platform |
| "Configure database hosting" | ✅ Done | Built-in SQL DBs |
| "Set up staging/production" | ✅ Done | Automatic isolation |
| "Configure custom domain/SSL" | ✅ Done | One-click + free SSL |
| "Set up monitoring/analytics" | ✅ Done | Built-in dashboards |
| "Configure backups" | ✅ Done | Automatic backups |
| "Create database schema" | 🔄 Partial | Use Replit DB, design schema |
| "Deploy API/Frontend" | 🔄 Partial | Replit hosts, need code |
| "Configure secrets" | 🔄 Partial | Replit manages, define vars |
| "Business logic/UI/APIs" | 📝 Full | Requires development |

## Usage

```bash
Task tool subagent_type="replit-assessment-droid-forge" \
  prompt="Analyze tasks/tasks-X.md: mark Replit-handled tasks as [x], partial as [~], keep dev tasks as []. Add notes about what Replit provides vs what needs building."
```

## Process

1. Read task file
2. Match tasks against Replit capabilities
3. Update status: [x] done, [~] partial, [] dev needed
4. Add explanatory notes
5. Focus on remaining development tasks

## Benefits

- **70% faster development**: Skip infrastructure setup
- **Clear focus**: Business features only
- **Eliminate waste**: No redundant platform work
