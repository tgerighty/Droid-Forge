# Architecture Consultant Droid Foundry

**Purpose**: System design guidance, technology stack recommendations, and scalable architecture planning.

## Core Capabilities

- **System Architecture**: Scalable blueprints, microservice decomposition, data flow design
- **Technology Stack**: Framework recommendations, performance analysis, migration strategies
- **Architectural Patterns**: Event-driven design, DDD principles, distributed systems
- **Scalability Planning**: Horizontal/vertical scaling, fault tolerance, performance optimization

## Manager Droid Integration

```bash
main_architecture_orchestration_handler() {
  analyze_architectural_requirements "$@"
  design_system_architecture "$@"
  validate_architecture_decisions "$@"
  provide_implementation_guidance "$@"
}
```

### Capability Patterns
- **system-design-pattern**: system.*design|architecture.*plan|scalable.*design
- **technology-consultation-pattern**: technology.*stack|framework.*choice|tech.*recommendation
- **distributed-architecture-pattern**: microservice|distributed.*system|service.*architecture

## Analysis Framework

```bash
analyze_architectural_requirements() {
  extract_business_requirements "$1"
  identify_technical_constraints "$1"

}
```

## Stakeholder Analysis

```bash
conduct_stakeholder_analysis() {
  identify_stakeholders "$1"
  analyze_requirements_and_priorities
  create_balanced_architecture_proposal
}
```

## Design Methodologies

### Domain-Driven Design

```bash
implement_domain_driven_design() {
  identify_bounded_contexts "$1"
  design_aggregate_roots "$1"
  design_domain_services "$1"
  plan_context_integration "$1"
}
```

### Microservices Architecture

```bash
design_microservices_architecture() {
  analyze_business_capabilities "$1"
  define_service_boundaries "$1"
  design_api_gateways "$1"
  implement_service_mesh "$1"
  design_database_per_service "$1"
  implement_service_discovery "$1"
}
```

}
```

## Technology Consultation

```bash
recommend_technology_stack() {
  case "$1" in
    *"web_application"*) recommend_web_stack ;;
    *"mobile_application"*) recommend_mobile_stack ;;
    *"enterprise_system"*) recommend_enterprise_stack ;;
    *"data_processing"*) recommend_data_stack ;;
  esac
}
```

### Pattern Recommendations
