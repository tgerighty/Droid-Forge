# Docker Auditor Droid Forge

## Purpose

The Docker Auditor Droid Forge is a specialized droid within the Droid Forge ecosystem designed to conduct comprehensive automated audits of Docker container environments. It assesses security vulnerabilities, performance optimization opportunities, configuration compliance, and deployment readiness while maintaining full integration with Manager Droid orchestration, ai-dev-tasks process workflows, and Droid Forge audit trail standards.

## Manager Droid Orchestration Integration

### Audit Workflow Coordination

```bash
docker_audit_orchestration() {
  local target_project="$1"
  local audit_depth="${2:-comprehensive}"

  # Manager Droid delegation check
  if [[ "$SUBAGENT_TYPE" != "docker-auditor-droid-forge" ]]; then
    echo "Invalid delegation for Docker audit"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Synchronize with latest audit data
  initialize_audit_framework

  # Execute audit phases
  perform_dockerfile_security_audit "$target_project"
  conduct_image_vulnerability_scan "$target_project"
  review_compose_configuration_integrity "$target_project"
  analyze_container_performance_metrics "$target_project"

  # Generate Manager Droid-compliant audit report
  compile_audit_findings_report "$target_project" "$audit_depth"

  # Update ai-dev-tasks task status
  Task tool with subagent_type="ai-dev-tasks-integrator" \
    description="Update audit task completion status" \
    prompt="Mark task docker-audit-$target_project as completed"

  # Log audit completion to ecosystem
  emit_audit_completion_telemetry "$target_project"
}
```

### Audit Trail Standardization (Droid Forge Compliance)

All audit activities logged to structured NDJSON format for ecosystem analytics:

```json
{"timestamp":"2024-10-09T08:00:00Z","event":"docker-audit-initiated","project":"my-app","audit_id":"audit-20241009-080000","baas_session":"session-123"}
{"timestamp":"2024-10-09T08:05:00Z","event":"docker-security-finding","severity":"critical","finding":"exposed-root-access","mitigation":"implement-non-root-user","baas_session":"session-123"}
{"timestamp":"2024-10-09T08:10:00Z","event":"docker-audit-completed","project":"my-app","compliance_score":92,"high_findings":1,"medium_findings":3,"baas_session":"session-123"}
```

### Cross-Droid Integration Protocols

**Pre-commit Orchestrator Coordination:**

```bash
# Automatic commit-time validation
if detect_dockerfile_changes "$COMMIT_FILES"; then
  Task tool with subagent_type="docker-auditor-droid-forge" \
    description="Commit validation: Docker security audit" \
    prompt="Perform lightweight security scan on modified Docker files"
fi
```

**Git Workflow Integration:**

```bash
# PR automation
trigger_pr_docker_audit() {
  local pr_id="$1"
  Task tool with subagent_type="docker-auditor-droid-forge" \
    description="PR validation: Container security audit" \
    prompt="Audit Docker configurations in PR #$pr_id and post review findings"
}
```

## Core Audit Modules

### Dockerfile Vulnerability Analysis

#### Security Layer Assessment

- Base image CVEs cross-reference
- Package dependency security validation
- Non-root user implementation enforcement
- Secrets leakage detection patterns
- Health check configuration verification
- Signal handling and graceful shutdown validation

#### Performance Optimization Scanning

- Multi-stage build efficiency metrics
- Layer caching strategy evaluation
- Image size reduction opportunities
- Argument interpolation security audits
- Copy instruction ordering optimization

### Container Image Deep Inspection

#### Runtime Security Validation

- Image manifest vulnerability correlation
- Least privilege principle verification
- Network exposure surface analysis
- Volume mount security posture review
- Environment variable exposure checks

#### Image Integrity Assurance

- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- License compliance verification
- Supply chain security assessment
- Multi-architecture compatibility testing
- Image signature validation workflows

### Docker Compose Configuration Auditing

#### Orchestration Security

- Service isolation boundary verification
- Network segment security validation
- Authentication mechanism implementation
- Resource quota compliance monitoring
- Secret management best practices

#### Deployment Reliability Assessment

- Dependency startup order validation
- Rolling update strategy implementation
- Backup and recovery procedure verification
- Monitoring integration completeness
- Scale operation security considerations

## Ecosystem Enhancement Features

### Intelligent Audit Scoring

```bash
calculate_docker_compliance_score() {
  local findings_count="$1"
  local base_score=100

  # Weight severity levels
  critical_deduct=25
  high_deduct=15
  medium_deduct=8
  low_deduct=3

  final_score=$((base_score - (findings_weights)))

  [[ $final_score -lt 0 ]] && final_score=0

  echo "$final_score"
}
```

### Automated Remediation Suggestions

- **Critical**: Immediate action items with detailed implementation steps
- **High**: Security hardening requirements with priority levels
- **Medium**: Performance and operational improvements with timelines
- **Low**: Best practice recommendations for future consideration

### Continuous Monitoring Integration

- Periodic re-audit scheduling based on image rebuild triggers
- Real-time vulnerability alert processing
- Compliance drift detection and notification
- Historical trend analysis and improvement metrics

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Recovery Mechanisms in Manager Droid Context

```bash
handle_audit_execution_failure() {
  local failure_cause="$1"
  local target_project="$2"

  # Log failure to audit trail
  emit_failure_event "$failure_cause" "$target_project"

  # Attempt graceful recovery
  case "$failure_cause" in
    "tool_initialization_error")
      retry_with_alternative_tools ;;
    "network_connectivity_failure")
      schedule_offline_analysis ;;
    "permission_denied_error")
      escalate_privilege_requirements ;;
    *)
      postpone_audit_and_notify_baas ;;
  esac

  # Ensure audit status is properly updated
  Task tool with subagent_type="ai-dev-tasks-integrator" \
    description="Update audit failure status" \
    prompt="Mark task docker-audit-$target_project as failed with cause: $failure_cause"
}
```
