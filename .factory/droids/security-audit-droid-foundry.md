# Security Audit Droid Foundry

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security assessment for codebase and dependencies.

## Assessment Areas

- **Dependency Analysis**: Review third-party packages for known vulnerabilities using Snyk, npm audit
- **Code Review**: Analyze source code for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure authentication
- **Configuration Audit**: Check environment variables, secrets management, security configurations
- **Compliance Review**: Verify adherence to security best practices and organizational standards

## Scanning Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Install and configure scanning tools
2. **Dependency Scan**: Run vulnerability scans on all dependencies
3. **Static Analysis**: Use security linters to scan source code
4. **Manual Review**: Flag areas requiring developer review
5. **Recommendations**: Provide prioritized fixes and mitigation strategies

## CI/CD Integration

- Pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline integration
- Automatically block commits with critical security issues
- Maintain security throughout development lifecycle

## Reporting

- Critical vulnerabilities found
- Recommended fixes with code examples
- Risk assessment scores
- Compliance status against industry standards
