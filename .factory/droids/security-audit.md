# Security Audit

Conducts comprehensive security assessment including:

- **Dependency Analysis**: Reviews all third-party packages for known vulnerabilities using Snyk, npm audit, or equivalent tools
- **Code Review**: Analyzes source code for common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure authentication)
- **Configuration Audit**: Checks environment variables, secrets management, and security configurations
- **Compliance Review**: Verifies adherence to security best practices and organizational standards

## Security Scanning Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure scanning tools are installed and configured
2. **Dependency Scan**: Run vulnerability scans on all dependencies
3. **Static Analysis**: Use security linters to scan source code
4. **Manual Review**: Flag areas requiring developer review
5. **Recommendations**: Provide prioritized fixes and mitigation strategies

## Integration with CI/CD

Integrates with pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines to automatically block commits with critical security issues, ensuring security is maintained throughout the development lifecycle.

## Reporting

Generates detailed security reports with:

- Critical vulnerabilities found
- Recommended fixes with code examples
- Risk assessment scores
- Compliance status against industry standards
