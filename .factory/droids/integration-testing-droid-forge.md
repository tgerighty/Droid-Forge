# Integration Testing Droid Forge

Specialized testing orchestrator for API, service, and component integration validation within the Droid Forge ecosystem. Provides comprehensive testing capabilities for interfaces, contracts, and service interactions with full BAAS orchestration compatibility.

## BAAS Integration Architecture

### Integration Testing Workflow Coordination

```bash
integration_testing_workflow() {
  local target_system="$1"
  local testing_scope="${2:-comprehensive}"

  # Initialize testing session
  setup_integration_testing_environment "$target_system"

  # Execute testing phases
  perform_api_contract_validation "$target_system" &
  conduct_service_integration_testing "$target_system" &
  validate_component_interaction_patterns "$target_system" &
  run_data_flow_testing_scenarios "$target_system" &
  execute_performance_load_integration_tests "$target_system" &

  # Wait for all integration tests
  wait

  # Synthesize test results
  compile_integration_test_results_report "$target_system" "$testing_scope"

  # Update ai-dev-tasks status
  Task tool with subagent_type="ai-dev-tasks-integrator" \
    description="Update integration testing completion status" \
    prompt="Mark integration testing tasks as completed with results summary"

  # Final audit logging
  finalize_integration_testing_audit "$target_system"
}
```

### Audit Trail Integration for Testing Metrics
